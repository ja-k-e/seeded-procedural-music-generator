# Seeded Procedural Music Generator

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jak_e/pen/EKRarY](https://codepen.io/jak_e/pen/EKRarY).

Procedural Generation allows you to create unique infiniteness that can be consistently reproduced. Enter seed data (your name is a great place to start) and hear a unique, infinite, and reproducible song.

Everything is notated in flats instead of sharps for simplicity sake.

Still has the occasional bug. If it doesnt play anything, refresh and try a new seed.
